ABOUT
GLBlender2 is the second part of an OpenGL ES & Blender tutorial series, teaching developers how to make an awesome 3D model viewer for iOS that can display models that you create in Blender.
In part 2, get ready to learn about the MTL material definition and file format, which youâ€™ll use to add Blender materials (i.e. colors, textures, and lighting properties that you can assign to a portion of a model) to your cube.
The full tutorial is available at:
